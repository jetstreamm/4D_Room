# 4D Room
You have been transported to a world with four spatial dimensions! Unfortunately, you are stuck inside a room with no exit. To pass the time, might as well practice seeing the fourth dimension.

## Introduction

### What is 4D? 
So, for those who are wondering how we can physically understand the fourth dimension, let's quickly go through the lower dimensions.
The 0<sup>th</sup> dimension is a point. Move in any direction and we get to the 1<sup>st</sup> dimension, a line.
While we are in the 1<sup>st</sup> dimension, we can move back and forth across the line. But we want more excitement in life, so we move away from the line. We have reached a 2D world. You can imagine this as an infinite flat sheet of paper.
Finally, to get to the 3<sup>rd</sup> dimension, aka the dimension humans live in, we jump up off the 2D plane.
Now, by analogy, to get to the 4<sup>th</sup> dimension, we need to move in a direction we have not moved in yet. If we could just "jump" in a new direction, we would enter the 4<sup>th</sup> dimension. And to cap that short summary, here is a picture of a tesseract -- the 4D equivalent of a cube!

### What is 4D Room?
You may have already seen the popular visualization of the fourth spatial dimension known as 4D Toys. To get a demonstration and a video explanation of what the fourth spatial dimension is, you can check out [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q) posted by the creator of 4D Toys.

The basis of 4D Room is different. 4D Toys allows you to see the _intersection_ of a 4D object with 3D space. 4D Room aims to show the _projection_ of a 4D object into 3D space. To make the difference clearer, here is a picture showing the intersection and the projection of a 3D cube in a 2D plane.



As you can see, the projection gives you a much clearer understanding of what the two-dimensional drawing represents. This is because the projection uses certain tricks to give a sense of depth in an additional dimension.

In this project, we begin with representing the shapes mathematically in 4D, calculate the rotations of these shapes, and then display their projections into lower dimensions that are understandable for humans. 

The current project stage has achieved visualizations of all six convex regular 4-polytopes -- the four-dimensional equivalent of the platonic solids -- under simple rotations in 2D. In plainer speech, we have a bunch of regular 4D shapes projected into the 2D, so you can view them on your screen. Examples of different tesseract rotations are shown below:

Upcoming steps include generation of random irregular 4-polytopes and porting to VR. We are particularly excited about putting these on a VR platform because interacting with these 4D objects as they move in a 3D space made possible by VR would increase the amount of information about these shapes we are able to retain when depicting them. Maybe our 3D brains will be more capable of understanding the 4th dimension!
